## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. PowerShell Command Syntax ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: `start java -jar target\VaultApp-1.0.0.jar` failed with parameter error.

**Solution**: Use correct PowerShell syntax:

```powershell
Start-Process java -ArgumentList '-jar', 'target\VaultApp-1.0.0.jar'
```

**Alternative**: Use the provided batch file:

```cmd
run.bat
```

### 2. Name Placeholders ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: About dialog and documentation still showed "[Your Full Name]" placeholders.

**Files Updated**:

- `src/main/java/com/vault/ui/AboutDialog.java` - Fixed copyright validation and email
- `src/main/java/com/vault/VaultApplication.java` - Updated contact email
- `README.md` - Replaced all name placeholders and fixed markdown lint issues

**Changes Made**:

- All "[Your Full Name]" ‚Üí "Lintshiwe Ntoampi"
- All "[Your Email Address]" ‚Üí "<lintshiwe.ntoampi@example.com>"
- Fixed copyright validation logic
- Corrected markdown lint issues

### 3. File Decryption Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Problem**: "Given final block not properly padded" error when opening files.

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- File `a_video_04-11-2025_14-42-52.webm` (82MB) cannot be decrypted
- All recovery methods failed (current password, default passwords, standard salt)
- This suggests the file was encrypted with a different password than currently stored

**Recovery Solution Created**:
A diagnostic tool `FileRecoveryDiagnostic.java` has been created to:

- List all encrypted files in the vault
- Try current database passwords
- Try common password combinations
- Allow manual password entry
- Update database if correct password is found

**To Use the Diagnostic Tool**:

```powershell
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.vault.util.FileRecoveryDiagnostic"
```

### 4. Maven Build Issues ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: JAR file locked during rebuild.

**Solution**: Stop Java processes before rebuilding:

```powershell
taskkill /F /IM java.exe
mvn clean package -q
```

## Recovery Recommendations

### For the Decryption Issue

1. **Run the Diagnostic Tool**:

   ```powershell
   mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.vault.util.FileRecoveryDiagnostic"
   ```

2. **If Recovery Fails**:

   - The file may have been encrypted with a password that was later changed
   - You may need to remember the original password used when the file was added
   - Consider if the file was added before any password changes

3. **Prevention for Future**:
   - Always test file decryption after password changes
   - Keep backup of important files before password changes
   - Use the re-encryption feature when changing passwords

### For Password Management

The application now includes:

- ‚úÖ Automatic re-encryption when changing passwords
- ‚úÖ Recovery mechanisms for multiple password scenarios
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Diagnostic tools for troubleshooting

## Application Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features

- Login system with proper authentication
- File upload and encryption (new files)
- Folder upload capability
- Dynamic UI and space management
- Password change functionality
- About dialog with correct copyright information
- Recovery mechanisms for most scenarios

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- Some files encrypted before recent updates may not decrypt with current password
- Files affected: Large video files (like the 82MB webm file)

### üîß Mitigation

- Use the FileRecoveryDiagnostic tool to identify correct passwords
- Re-add affected files if original passwords cannot be recovered
- Future files will work correctly with the current system

## Usage Instructions
