# Test Report: Infinite Recursion Fix

## Problem Summary

The issue was infinite recursion between:

- `VaultService.retrieveFile()` (line 165)
- `VaultService.attemptFileRecovery()` (line 413)

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at the stack trace, the pattern was:

1. `retrieveFile()` calls `tryRecoveryDecryption()` on decryption failure
2. `tryRecoveryDecryption()` was somehow calling back to `retrieveFile()`
3. This created an infinite loop causing StackOverflowError

## Fix Applied

### Previous Issue

The old code had a method called `attemptFileRecovery()` that was calling `retrieveFile()`, creating the recursion.

### Current Solution

1. **Eliminated the problematic `attemptFileRecovery()` method**
   - Confirmed it doesn't exist in current codebase
2. **Enhanced `tryRecoveryDecryption()` method**
   - Now tries multiple recovery strategies without calling `retrieveFile()`
   - Uses direct decryption with different keys
   - Added `getAllAdmins()` method to DatabaseManager for comprehensive recovery
3. **Recovery Strategy**
   - Try with each admin's salt + default password
   - Try with authenticated default admin credentials
   - Try with standard salt as fallback
   - Each attempt uses `tryDecryptWithKey()` which handles decryption directly

### Key Improvements

- **No recursive calls**: `tryRecoveryDecryption()` never calls `retrieveFile()`
- **Multiple recovery attempts**: Tries different credential combinations
- **Direct decryption**: Uses `SecurityUtil.decrypt()` directly
- **Proper error handling**: Catches exceptions at each recovery level

## Code Flow Analysis

### Safe Recovery Path

```java
retrieveFile()
  → [decryption fails]
  → tryRecoveryDecryption()
    → tryDecryptWithKey() [multiple attempts]
      → SecurityUtil.decrypt() [direct call]
      → FileUtils.writeByteArrayToFile()
    → return File [or null]
  → return File [or throw exception]
```

### No More Recursive Calls

- ✅ `tryRecoveryDecryption()` is self-contained
- ✅ `tryDecryptWithKey()` only calls utility methods
- ✅ No calls back to `retrieveFile()` from recovery methods

## Testing Status

- [x] Code compilation successful
- [x] No compilation errors in VaultService.java
- [x] No compilation errors in DatabaseManager.java
- [x] Added getAllAdmins() method for comprehensive recovery
- [x] Fixed salt type conversion issues

## Expected Behavior

When file decryption fails:

1. System will attempt recovery with different credential combinations
2. Each recovery attempt will be logged
3. If successful, returns recovered file with "_recovery_" suffix
4. If all recovery attempts fail, throws RuntimeException
5. **No infinite recursion or StackOverflowError**

## Files Modified

1. `VaultService.java` - Enhanced recovery logic
2. `DatabaseManager.java` - Added getAllAdmins() method

## Next Steps

1. Test with actual file that previously caused infinite recursion
2. Verify recovery works for password-changed scenarios
3. Test all three scenarios from original requirements
