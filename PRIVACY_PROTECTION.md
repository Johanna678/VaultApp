# 🔒 SECURITY & PRIVACY PROTECTION

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a Secure Vault Application

### 🛡️ PRIVACY PROTECTION MEASURES

**This application is designed to protect your files. When others use this application:**

1. **ISOLATED USER DATA** - Each user has their own isolated vault directory
2. **NO SHARED ACCESS** - Users cannot access each other's encrypted files
3. **LOCAL STORAGE ONLY** - All data is stored locally, never transmitted
4. **ENCRYPTION KEYS** - Each user's encryption keys are unique and isolated

### 🔐 USER ISOLATION IMPLEMENTATION

The application automatically creates separate vault directories:

```
User 1: C:\Users\[username1]\.securevault\
User 2: C:\Users\[username2]\.securevault\
User 3: C:\Users\[username3]\.securevault\
```

**Each user's data is completely isolated and encrypted with their own credentials.**

### 🚨 DEVELOPER SECURITY NOTES

**FOR REPOSITORY USERS:**

- No personal files are included in this repository
- All example credentials are for demonstration only
- The application uses per-user encryption keys
- No sensitive data is hardcoded in the source code

### 📁 WHAT'S SAFE TO SHARE

✅ **SAFE TO SHARE:**

- Source code and documentation
- Application binaries and installers
- Configuration examples
- Test files (non-sensitive)
- Diagnostic utilities

❌ **NEVER SHARED:**

- User's encrypted vault files (`.securevault` directories)
- Database files containing user credentials
- Personal encryption keys
- Actual user documents/media

### 🔧 DEPLOYMENT SECURITY
